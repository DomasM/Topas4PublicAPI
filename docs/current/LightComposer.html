            <h3 id="intro">Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                LightComposer is an end-user-oriented application for controlling OPA-based
                laser sources produced by Light Conversion. Interactive laser system
                control via the LightComposer GUI is described in the User Manual of a
                particular system, this document covers local and remote control via the
                LightComposer API.
            </p>
            <p>
                LightComposer provides a GUI for interactive laser system control and an
                API service for remote control, automation and advanced applications.
                LightComposer operates on top of Topas4, whose server component carries out
                the actual hardware control. Depending on system configuration, one or more
                Topas4 server instances are used for hardware control and all must be
                running for the laser system to function properly. Running the LightComposer
                application should start all the necessary server instances. From the
                API user standpoint, communication occurs between the client application
                and the LightComposer app, all the necessary backend operations
                are handled by LightComposer.
            </p>

            <h3 id="api-control-basics">API Control Basics</h3>
            <p>
                API control is provided via a REST interface. API calls between the client and
                the LightComposer application are sessionless, i.e., there are no handles,
                control locks or opening/closing of devices. Multiple clients can use the REST service at the
                same time, and the LightComposer GUI can be used at the same time as well.
            </p>
			<p>
				The REST interface can be accessed from the LightComposer GUI
				by opening the settings menu (A) and clicking on the Remote
				Control Help Page button (B).
			</p>
			<img src="assets/images/rest-help-button.png" alt="Rest button location" style="width: 500px" />
			
            <p>
                The remote application sends API commands as HTTP REST requests
                to the LightComposer application. A response is sent back to
                the remote application as part of an HTTP exchange. The
                contents of the REST messages are serialized using JSON.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since REST commands are sessionless they are non-blocking. As a result,
                commands that take some time to finish (e.g. set wavelength, set GDD, open
                shutter) are only initiated by the REST command. You can track the progress
                of these actions by repeatedly polling their status.
            </p>

                <strong>You can test whether the API calls in your application
                    are correct without a physical device.</strong>

                WinTopas4 supports virtual/demo devices, which accept GUI and
                REST commands just as real devices would, with the following
                limitations:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Interlock canâ€™t be activated</li>
                <li>Beam steering will not be available</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                To start a virtual device, launch WinTopas4, click Tools&gt;Launch Demo Device and
                select 'Cronus-3P'.
            </p>
            <!--<p>When running all examples (except Postman) make sure to provide correct serial number of your own device. Place to do so is clearly marked in code, e.g</p>
    <pre><code>static void Main (string[] args) {
                var serialNumber = &quot;00666&quot;; //change to actual serial number of your own device.
                var example = new Topas4SDKExample (serialNumber);
                example.Run ();
            }
    </code></pre>-->
            <h4>Postman</h4>

            <p>
                We recommend Postman for quick and simple API testing as well
                as to check whether the client computer can communicate with
                the host running the LightComposer REST service at all. A
                Postman collection is provided for this purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/fe1155fdfb9980124abd"><img src="https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg" alt="Run in Postman" /></a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Make sure to set the correct URL for your device after you
                import the collection. A typical URL is: 
				http://127.0.0.1:35120/CTP21456/v0/, where CTP21456 is the
				serial number of your device, 127.0.0.1 is the IP address
				(localhost, in this case) and 35120 is the REST service port.
            </p>
            <p>
                Postman should be your first troubelshooting step. We can only
                offer limited support if an API command is not working in a
                particular user application but the corresponding request
                in Postman returns the expected result. We will ask you to
                provide an output log from Postman when you inquire for
                assistance, so it is best to have it before reaching out.
