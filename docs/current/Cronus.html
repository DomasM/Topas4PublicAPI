            <h3 id="intro">Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                Cronus control application is an end-user-oriented application for controlling OPO-based
                laser sources produced by Light Conversion. Interactive laser system
                control via the Cronus GUI is described in the User Manual of a
                particular system, this document covers local and remote control via the
                Cronus API.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cronus provides a GUI for interactive laser system control and an
                API service for remote control, automation and advanced applications.
                Cronus operates on top of Topas4, whose server component carries out
                the actual hardware control. Depending on system configuration, one or more
                Topas4 server instances are used for hardware control and all must be
                running for the laser system to function properly. Running the Cronus
                application should start all the necessary server instances. From the
                API user standpoint, communication occurs between the client application
                and the Cronus app, all the necessary backend operations
                are handled by Cronus.
            </p>

                <div style="color:red;">
                    Demo software should only be installed and used on users PC, not the internal Cronus PC if you already have the physical device.
                </div>
                <p>To start developing your application that integrates Cronus control download setup file and launch it. Grant admin rights when requested. You will find application later on by name Cronus-Demo.<p>
            </p>



            <h3 id="api-control-basics">API Control Basics</h3>
            <p>
                API control is provided via a REST interface and COM port. COM port control is considered legacy method and is described <a href="https://gist.github.com/DomasM/2f802a24d4a354b020b66f2d89267003">here</a> API calls between the client and
                the Cronus application are sessionless, i.e., there are no handles,
                control locks or opening/closing of devices. Multiple clients can use the REST service at the
                same time, and the Cronus GUI can be used at the same time as well.
            </p>
            <!--<p>
        Local help file for remote control can be found at C:\Programs\Cronus\ if Cronus application is running
    </p>-->

            <p>
                The remote application sends API commands as HTTP REST requests
                to the Cronus application. A response is sent back to
                the remote application as part of an HTTP exchange. The
                contents of the REST messages are serialized using JSON.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since REST commands are sessionless they are non-blocking. As a result,
                commands that take some time to finish (e.g. set wavelength, set GDD, open
                shutter) are only initiated by the REST command. You can track the progress
                of these actions by repeatedly polling their status.
            </p>
